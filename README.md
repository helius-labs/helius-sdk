![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/helius-sdk)

The Helius Node.js SDK provides access to Helius-related methods and APIs using TypeScript, making building on Solana as easy as possible.

## Documentation

API reference documentation is available at [helius.dev/docs](https://www.helius.dev/docs).

## Installation

Using pnpm (recommended):

```shell
pnpm add helius-sdk
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install helius-sdk
```

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn add helius-sdk
```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your account's API key, which is available in the [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/).

```ts
import { createHelius } from "helius-sdk";

(async () => {
  const apiKey = ""; // From Helius dashboard
  const helius = createHelius({ apiKey });

  try {
    const assets = await helius.getAssetsByOwner({
      ownerAddress: "owner_address_goes_here",
      page: 1,
      limit: 50,
      sortBy: { sortBy: "created", sortDirection: "asc" },
    });

    console.log("Fetched assets:", assets);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
})();
```

### Migrating to `helius-sdk` 2.0.0
The Helius Node.js SDK has been rewritten from the ground up in version 2.0.0 to use [`@solana/kit` (i.e., Kit)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/kit) under the hood, replacing the dependency on `@solana/web3.js` versions higher than 1.73.2.

We've gone to great lengths to ensure that the developer experience remains largely the same, with minimal impact on existing code. The API methods and namespaces are designed to be intuitive and an improvement on previous versions, so migrating to the latest version is relatively straightforward. There are a plethora of examples found in the `examples` directory, organized by namespace, to aid in this migration.

For more detailed migration help, refer to the following [migration guide](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk/blob/main/MIGRATION.md)

For general help with Kit, please refer to [Kit's new documentation site](https://www.solanakit.com/)

## Handling errors

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), an error message will be thrown:

```ts
try {
  const assets = await helius.getAssetsByOwner({
    ownerAddress: "owner_address_goes_here",
    page: 1,
    limit: 50,
    sortBy: { sortBy: "created", sortDirection: "asc" },
  });

  console.log("Fetched assets:", assets);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

### Common Error Codes

When working with the Helius SDK, you may encounter several error codes. Below is a table detailing some of the common error codes along with additional information to help you troubleshoot:

| Error Code | Error Message         | More Information                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 401        | Unauthorized          | This occurs when an invalid API key is provided or access is restricted due to RPC rules.              |
| 429        | Too Many Requests     | This indicates that the user has exceeded the request limit in a given timeframe or is out of credits. |
| 5XX        | Internal Server Error | This is a generic error message for server-side issues. Please contact Helius support for assistance.  |

If you encounter any of these errors, refer to the Helius documentation for further guidance, or reach out to the Helius support team for more detailed assistance.

## Using the Helius SDK

Our SDK is designed to give you a seamless experience when building on Solana. We've separated the core functionality into various segments. Examples for individual methods can be found in the `examples` directory, with examples organized by namespace.

[**DAS API**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/das-api)
