# Contributing to the Helius Node.js SDK

Thank you for considering contributing to the Helius Node.js SDK and related repositories. We appreciate your time and effort. This document outlines how you can contribute to the project.

## Style Guide

To maintain a clean and consistent codebase, please adhere to  these conventions:

- File Naming: Use `camelCase` or `kebab-case`, consistent with the rest of the codebase.
- Entry Files: Prefer meaningful filenames over generic ones like `index.ts`, unless used as module boundaries.
- Type Safety: We use TypeScriptâ€”ensure all new code is strongly typed.
- Formatting & Linting: Run `pnpm format` and `pnpm lint` before committing to ensure code style consistency.
- Documentation: Update documentation if your changes affect how the SDK is used.
- Testing: Add or update unit tests for any new or modified functionality using our test suite.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the SDK. We actively welcome all contributions! To contribute:

- Fork the repository and create your branch from main
- Install dependencies, use `pnpm` for package management.
    ```bash
    # Install pnpm if you don't have it (requires Node.js)
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install project dependencies
    pnpm install
    ```
- Make your changes in a clearly scoped branch (e.g., `feat/my-feature`, `fix/bug-description`)
- Add or update tests for new functionality
- Ensure all checks pass by running:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

- Format and lint your code:

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm lint
```

- Open a pull request with a clear description and reference any related issues

### Good Pull Request Titles

- `fix(paginator): Correct offset behavior in getTransactions`
- `feat(wallets): Add support for bulk wallet queries`
- `docs(auth): Update example for environment setup`

### Avoid Titles Like

- `fix #1234`
- `update code`
- `misc changes`

### Related Issues

If your pull request addresses an open issue, please mention it in the description (e.g., `Closes #1234`).
