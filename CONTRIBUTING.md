# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Helius Node.js SDK! Thank you for considering to contribute; we value your contributions and want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute. Here's how you can help make the SDK better

## Style Guide

To maintain high standards of quality and readability, code should adhere to the following principles:

- **File Naming**: Use `camelCase` or `kebab-case`, consistent with the rest of the codebase
- **Entry Files**: Prefer meaningful filenames over generic ones like `index.ts`, unless used as module boundaries
- **Type Safety**: We use TypeScriptâ€”ensure all new code is strongly typed
- **Formatting & Linting**: Run `pnpm format` and `pnpm lint` before committing to ensure code style consistency
- **Documentation**: Update documentation if your changes affect how the SDK is used
- **Testing**: Add or update unit tests for any new or modified functionality

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the SDK. We actively welcome all contributions! To contribute:

- Fork the repository and create your branch from main
- Install all project dependencies using `pnpm`
    ```bash
    # Install pnpm if you don't have it (requires Node.js)
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install project dependencies
    pnpm install
    ```
- Make your changes in a clearly scoped branch (e.g., `feat/my-feature`, `fix/bug-description`)
- Add or update tests for new functionality
- Ensure all checks pass by running:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

- Format and lint your code:

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm lint
```

- Open a pull request with a clear description and reference any related issues

### Good Pull Request Titles

- `fix(paginator): Correct offset behavior in getTransactions`
- `feat(wallets): Add support for bulk wallet queries`
- `docs(auth): Update example for environment setup`

### Avoid Titles Like

- `fix #1234`
- `update code`
- `misc changes`

### Related Issues

If your pull request addresses an open issue, please mention it in the description (e.g., `Closes #1234`).
