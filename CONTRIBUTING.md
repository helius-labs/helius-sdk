# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Helius Node.js SDK! Thank you for considering to contribute; we value your input and want to make it as easy as possible for you to help. Here's how you can help make the SDK better. Before starting, please read this guide carefully to ensure your contributions align with our standards.

## Style Guide

To maintain high standards of quality, readability, and performance, code should adhere to the following principles:

- **File Naming**: Use `camelCase` or `kebab-case`, consistent with the rest of the codebase.
- **Entry Files**: Prefer meaningful filenames over generic ones like `index.ts`, unless used as module boundaries.
- **Type Safety**: We use TypeScriptâ€”ensure all new code is strongly typed.
- **Formatting**: Run `pnpm format` to ensure code style consistency.
- **Tree-Shakability**: Avoid top-level side effects.
- **Async Handling**: Use async/await for asynchronous operations, wrapped in try/catch blocks.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors robustly, propagating meaningful messages with the relevant error codes from both Helius and Kit.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation if your changes affect how the SDK is used.
- **Testing**: Add or update unit/integrations tests for any new or modified functionality. Aim for 65%+ test coverage.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the SDK. We actively welcome all contributions! To contribute:

- Fork the repository and create your branch from main
- Install all project dependencies using `pnpm`

  ```bash
  # Install pnpm if you don't have it (requires Node.js)
  npm install -g pnpm

  # Install project dependencies
  pnpm install
  ```

- Make your changes in a clearly scoped branch (e.g., `feat/my-feature`, `fix/bug-description`)
- Add or update tests for new functionality
- Ensure all checks pass by running:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm check-bundle # Verified tree-shakability and bundle sizes
```

- Format your code:

```bash
pnpm format
```

- Open a pull request with a clear description and reference any related issues

### Good Pull Request Titles

- `fix(paginator): Correct offset behavior in getTransactions`
- `feat(wallets): Add support for bulk wallet queries`
- `docs(auth): Update example for environment setup`

### Avoid Titles Like

- `fix #1234`
- `update code`
- `misc changes`

### Related Issues

If your pull request addresses an open issue, please mention it in the description (e.g., `Closes #1234`).
