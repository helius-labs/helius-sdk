## Project Context

The Helius SDK is a Node.js library that provides seamless access to various Helius APIs for interacting with the Solana. The codebase is written in TypeScript, leverages @solana/kit for blockchain operations, Jest for testing, and uses pnpm for dependency management. It is designed to offer robust, modular, and high-performance tooling for developers building on Solana.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Node.js & Architecture:**  
  - Follow best practices for Node.js development and maintain a modular code structure.
  - Organize functionality into clear segments (e.g., DAS API, Webhooks, Smart Transactions, and Helper Methods).

- **TypeScript & Code Quality:**  
  - Enforce strict TypeScript typing with well-defined interfaces.
  - Always use descriptive, full names for variables and functions (avoid abbreviations).
  - Prefer arrow functions over traditional function declarations.
  - Use `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is necessary.
  - Use async/await for all asynchronous operations and wrap them in try/catch blocks.
  - Assume that thrown objects are instances of `Error`â€”do not throw non-Error objects.
  - Use double quotes (" ") for all string literals; single quotes (' ') should be avoided except in JSON strings or when escaping. 

- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  - Include clear JSDoc comments for public methods and modules.
  - Maintain inline examples and usage notes for more complex interactions.

- **Blockchain & API Integration:**  
  - Use @solana/kit for all interactions with Solana.
  - Integrate with the Helius API correctly, ensuring proper authentication and robust error handling.
  - Use asynchronous patterns consistently and handle network or blockchain errors comprehensively.

- **Project Tools & Conventions:**  
  - Manage dependencies with pnpm and adhere to the versions specified in package.json.
  - Ensure code is modular, testable, and maintainable.
  - Write unit and integration tests using Jest for critical components to guarantee reliable performance.
